# Learn Python, for fun and profit

This document repository introduces you to Python programming. Most people have fun in learning Python and they can make big profit if they have big fun.

Unlike most textbooks or tutorials, we write this document with an important principle: teaching the professional way of Python programming. "Professional" means the best practices in Python programming used by professional programmers. Following is a short list of best practices we follow in this document:

- Design with test cases before coding.
- Follow the [PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and use VS Code PyLint tool to enforce the style.
- No magic numbers.
- Short functions/methods.
- Design, code, test and debug incrementally.
- Refactoring is part of development.

The followin is table of content. It is organzied based on topics, not on a textbook chpater order. As a program, you count from `0`:
