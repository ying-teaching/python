# Summary

The only way you can learn programming is programming a lot. Teachers, books, videos etc are only tools/helpers. The only way is learning-by-doing.

Now it is time to review three things:

- why you should learn programming
- what you have learned
- what are the next to learn.

## 1 Why Should You Learn Programming

Different people have different answers. For example, Steve Jobs once said, "Everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer... because it teaches you how to think." This could be one important reason to learn programming, but there are many benefits, both for fun and for profit.

The article [Why Should I Learn to Code? 17 Reasons to Learn Programming](https://codersbible.com/why-should-i-learn-to-code-17-reasons-to-learn-programming//) gives some good reasons that you can read it to get the full details. Following is a partial list of reasons and you can develop your reasons to learn programming:

- Programming careers have great earning potential: 2019 median annual salary is above $80,000.
- Demand remains strong for coding-related jobs, still growing.
- Coding ability gives new perspective to problem-solving.
- Learning to code offers career flexibility: digital economy becomes bigger everyday and coding is critical for any kind of business. You can choose the kind of business you like.
- Build something cool: you have a powerful tool that beyond human imagination just 50 years ago. It let you experss your creativity.
- There is an abundance for free online high quality resources.

## 2 What You Have Laerned

Upon completion of this course, each student will be able to build a programmer’s mindset and master the following concepts/skill.

## 2.1 Programming mindset

- You should understand the requirement/questions before you work on it.
- You should design a solution before you write code.
- You should code incrementally — always have a runnable program without syntax errors.
- You know how to think logically and carefully, one simple typo can crash the whole program, one logic error can cause big damage.
- You should follow the best practices in writing code: naming, format etc.

## 2.2 Programming concepts

- Read input
- Print output with f-string
- Use if-elif-else
- Use for and while loop
- Define and call functions
- Read/write files: line by line, fields in a line, ‘with’ to free resources
- Data types, their methods and applications: String, List, Tuple, Dictionary, Set
- Commonly used functions/methods
  - Random number
  - Turtle graphics
  - Plot digrams
  - Math module
- Advanced topics (no test/exam, but nice to know)
  - Exceptions and error handling
  - Class and Object
  - Anonymous function

## 3 What’s the next

### 3.1 To learn more Python

[Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e) It is a well-organized book you can read and try all the projects in this book.

[Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/):This web site has a set of free materials, lectures, book and assignments to help students learn how to program in Python. You can take this course and receive a certificate at
