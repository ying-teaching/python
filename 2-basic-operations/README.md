## Data, Expression and Statement

The constructs of a program can be classified into three kinds: data, expression and statement. Data represent the information to be processed by the program. They can be booleans, numbers, strings or a mix of them.

An expression’s objective is to operate on one more more pieced of data and produce a value. For example, add two numbers, compare two numbers (the result is a boolean value) or find a substring from a string.

A statement’s main job is to produce changes in the program. Change are also called effects or states of the program. A statement may change the program states by creating a variable, changing the data in a varaible, writing data to a file or reading data from a database.

## Sequneces, Selections and Repetitions

As in real life, the operations of a program take three forms:

- Sequences: execute one after another
- Selections: perform different operations for different conditions
- Repetitions: keep doing some operations for a nubmer of times or until some conditions change.
