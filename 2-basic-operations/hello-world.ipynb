    "`print` is the name of a Python's built-in function that displays (prints) something to your computer console:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A function is a piece of program that performs a specific task. Here, it displays a message to your computer sonsole. A `console` is your terminal (Mac OS or Linux) or commmand line (Windows) screen.\n",
    "- The `print` function is provided by the Python interpreter, thus it is a `built-in` function. Your program will define many functions to perform different tasks for your problem domain. These functions are application functions, not built-in functions.  \n",
    "- A function, as defined in math, takes some values as its input and produce an output. Those input values are called `arguments` of a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2: `()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `()` is a pair of parentheses that separates a function name from its arguments. The arguments (input) of the function are put inside a pair of parenthese after a function name.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The `'Hello World!'` is the input for the function. It is the single argument in the above function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is a `string literal`.\n",
    "- The `string` is the data type of `'Hello World!'`. A data type defines a set of data that share some common properties. For example, a `string` has a sequence of characters quoted in a pair of single quotation marks.\n",
    "- A `literal` is a programming notation/representation for a fix value in source code. Here, you want to say the sequnence of characters of `Hello World!` that is a string data type in Python. Python requires that string literals be quoted in a pair of single quotation marks.\n",

    "\n",
    "### All together: `print('Hello World!')`\n",

    "- `invoke` a function: a funciton `invocation`\n",
